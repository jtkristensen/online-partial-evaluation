# A simple minded online partial evaluator for a first order functional language.

We implement a partial evaluator in the style suggested by Cook and LÃ¤mmel
in the paper `Tutorial on Online Partial Evaluation` as published in the
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science journal
(EPTCS2011). See also chapter 5 in `Partial Evaluation and Automatic Program
Generation` by Jones, Gomard and Sestoft.

You can find an instructive example in `app/Main.hs`. Try it out using
`stack run`.
